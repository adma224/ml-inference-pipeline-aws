# AWS Serverless Generative ML Microservices Infra with CloudFormation & CI/CD

## News Headline Generator â€“ GPT-2 Headline Completion Web App

This web app generates full news headlines based on a few typed words using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. It's powered entirely by a serverless AWS backend and showcases A/B inference routing, metadata tracking, and CI/CD automation (more below).

## Project Description

This project showcases an advanced, production-style ML inference pipeline built on AWS using SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway, and CDK. It showcases modern microservices principles by implementing loosely coupled, single-responsibility components deployed serverlessly for scalable, fault-isolated ML serving. Designed for real-world relevance, it includes A/B testing capabilities, model versioning, feedback logging, and model output analytics with plans for visualization. A fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions ensures continuous delivery and infrastructure consistency.

More than just infrastructure, this project demonstrates current MLOps practices and hands-on expertise in deploying generative AI workflows (GPT2) with a focus on scalability, modularity, and cost efficiency.
