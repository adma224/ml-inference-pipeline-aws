# :poodle: A/B Model Inference Pipeline with AWS CDK and CI/CD

This project demonstrates a scalable, production-style A/B inference pipeline using AWS CDK, Lambda, API Gateway, and SageMaker. It includes a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions and is designed to showcase mid-level skills in AWS Cloud Engineering, DevOps, Machine Learning Engineering, and MLOps.

## Project Goals

- Deploy and manage multiple ML models using AWS SageMaker
- Route inference requests using an A/B testing mechanism
- Automate infrastructure and deployment using AWS CDK
- Collect and analyze feedback to evaluate model performance
- Implement CI/CD best practices using GitHub Actions
- Gradually scale to include training, model versioning, and evaluation
